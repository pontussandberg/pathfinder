<h1>Pathfinder / Maze solver</h1>

<p>I challenged both my JavaScript and programming skills with this project.</p>
<p>This app will find a way through a maze with the recursion method. I also added a priority method with Pythagoras theorem. With this the program will always <i>try</i> to take the <i>"bee line"</i> to the target.</p>
<p>When the target is reached the app will try to take a shorter way back, learning from the first journey.</p>
